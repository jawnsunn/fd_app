  - Made fd_app project public
  - Can currently read .json files formatted in listed array format
  - Looking into developing basic UI for this.

  - developed separate function called frameDataPrint(name,move) and frameDataGather(name, move) to make things more efficient in regards to entering moves. Still a mess though...
  - Thinking about coding this in Java at some point for the sake of Android app development.
